First we created an adjacency list, it is an easy way to create a list where the vertex has a list of its adjacent nodes stored
the dfs is an algorimth that checks if vertices are able to be reach or not, so we have a dfs function that calls dfs visits, where each
vertex has a color, and changes it when it has been visted or not.
