For my implementation of project 1 of the priority queue, a tree stored noes of each customer that had the names (n) and data (priority), the nice thing by using tree it is dynamic in size, so it can be dynamic. 
The compare is done in the insert function, where it first checks if there is a head, and creates a new head or compares the inserted node.
My assumptions is that each customer has a priority number, and do not have a case where that is possible.
For my program to run, all you need is the input text file in the terminal argument 
To run:
    $ g++ main.cpp
    $ ./a.out input.txt
