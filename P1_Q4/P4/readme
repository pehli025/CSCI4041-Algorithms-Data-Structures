The assumtion here is also the same as P3, where the array size is 10000, I used 26 buckets, 1 for each letter of the alphabet, where the max number of items in a bucket is 10.
I have variables begin and end for the starting and ending index for each bucket. Creates a new bucket itf its full. letters contains each bucket, where it is loaded into an array, sorted and loading back.

To run:
    $ g++ main.cpp
    $ ./a.out input.txt
